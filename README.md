# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to utilize the process of extract, transform, and load (ETL) on crowdfunding data. Here we took the data on crowdfunding campaigns, organized it, cleaned it, and grouped the data into a coherent model using python and PostgreSQL for queries regarding campaign backer data and contact information.
